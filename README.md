# Deploy contract and Minting.

#### Smart token builder to test for deploying contract on BSC

## Develop and Deploy Smart Contracts with Truffle on Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

Create a smart contract, compile and deploy it using the Truffle Framework and add Unit Tests for the contract logic using Truffle. Deploy the smart contract in Ganache-CLI with Truffle. Then write unit tests for the smart contract and test it with Truffle. The contract will be written in Solidity. Before getting started, Truffle and Ganache-cli must be installed. Ganache-cli will be the tool we will use to create a private blockchain that runs on our machine only.

## Requirements
* Ganache-CLI
* Truffle

### website

## Truffle Init
1.	Set the Truffle and Ganache-cli

2.	If you already have Ganache-cli installed just skip this step, otherwise open terminal console and write command:
```bash
 npm install -g ganache-cli@6.4.5
```
3. The `port` in which ganache-cli communicates is `8545`. 

## Deploy a Smart Contract
 
```bash
$ truffle migrate
```
#### abi files should be copy in client/src/contract folder.

### Set private sale and public sale time.

## Solutions
* Connect various wallets
* Gas in web3.js
* Set private and public time in solidity and website.
* staking
